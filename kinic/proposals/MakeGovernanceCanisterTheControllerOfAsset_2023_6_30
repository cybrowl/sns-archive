  summary="For a governance canister to execute the functions of an asset canister, the governance canister must be the controller of the asset canister or have ManagePermissions.
  This DeRegisterProposal can be used to set controllers, therefore DAO can set the controllers to the root canister and governance canister. 
  And then, SNS registers the asset canister using RegisterProposal again.
  
  
  Note; These processes are completely controlled by the SNS and anyone can propose the RegisterProposal because the root canister remains the controller of the asset.";
