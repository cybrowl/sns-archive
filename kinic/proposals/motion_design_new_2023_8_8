  summary="## ðŸ“• Background

  Kinic recently had a decentralized design competition. The [winning design](https://twitter.com/kinic_app/status/1686961073357000704?s=20) has been selected by judges and the community via voting. The Kinic Developer Organization would like to commission this design while the core team continues working on important backend updates.
  
  ## ðŸ‘Ÿ What this motion is for?
  This motion is to show that the DAO has approved the design work as chosen in the competition. Funds from the Kinic Developer Organization will be used; no extra funds from the treasury are being requested.
  
  1. The DAO has decided on the winning design.
  2. Create grants to commission the design work.
  3. Create another proposal in the future to update Kinic FE to this new design.";
